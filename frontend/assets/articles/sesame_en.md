**Detailed Sesame (Til) Farming Guide with References**

_Based on ICAR-IIOR and Indian Agricultural Institution Recommendations_

**About Sesame**

Sesame (til) is a major oilseed crop in India, well adapted to dry and rainfed conditions. It is energy-rich and fits well in crop rotations, contributing to soil health and diversified farming systems. Sesame is cultivated in Kharif, Rabi, and summer seasons across various regions of India[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#fn1)[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2).

**1\. Planting**

**Types of Seeds Used**

- Certified seeds of improved varieties such as **Cums-17, Prachi, Amrit, JCS-1020** are recommended for higher yield and disease resistance[<sup>\[3\]</sup>](#fn3)[<sup>\[4\]</sup>](#fn4).
- Treat seeds with fungicides like **Captan or Thiram (3 g/kg seed)** or bioagents like **Trichoderma (5 g/kg seed)** before sowing to prevent seed-borne diseases[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2).

**Soil Preparation Methods**

- Plough the field 2–3 times to obtain fine tilth, ensuring removal of weeds and crop residues to reduce pest and disease pressure[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#fn1)[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2).
- Level the field to avoid waterlogging, as sesame is sensitive to excess moisture[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2)[<sup>\[5\]</sup>](#fn5).
- Incorporate **5–10 tons of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) per hectare** before sowing to improve soil fertility and moisture retention[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#fn1)[<sup>\[6\]</sup>](#fn6)[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2).
- Prepare beds and furrows for good drainage, especially in heavier soils[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#fn1).

**Special Tools or Equipment Needed**

- Tractor or plough for land preparation.
- Harrow or hoe for tilling and weeding.
- Seed drill or hand tools for sowing.
- Sickle for harvesting.

**Ideal Weather and Temperature Conditions for Planting**

- Sesame grows best at temperatures between **27°C and 33°C**, with an optimum range of 25–30°C[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2)[<sup>\[5\]</sup>](#fn5).
- It tolerates drought but is highly sensitive to waterlogging and frost.
- Suitable for tropical and subtropical climates.
- Sowing windows vary by region:
  - **Kharif:** June–July
  - **Rabi:** October–November
  - **Summer:** January–March[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2)[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#fn1).

**Sowing Techniques and Spacing Tips**

- Use a seed rate of **3–5 kg/ha for line sowing** and **5–7 kg/ha for broadcasting**[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#fn1)[<sup>\[6\]</sup>](#fn6)[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2).
- Mix seeds with sand or dry soil in a **1:20 ratio** to ensure even distribution during sowing[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#fn1).
- Sow seeds at a shallow depth of **2.5 cm**; avoid deep sowing to ensure good germination[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2).
- Maintain row spacing of **30 cm** and plant spacing of **15 cm** for optimal growth and aeration[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#fn1)[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2).
- Line sowing is preferred for better intercultural operations and higher yields[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2).

**2\. Growth**

**Crop Care and Watering Schedule**

- Sesame is mostly rainfed during Kharif; provide **protective irrigation during prolonged dry spells** to avoid moisture stress[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2)[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#fn1).
- Rabi and summer crops require **2–3 irrigations** at flowering and pod-filling stages[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2).
- Avoid over-irrigation and waterlogging as sesame roots are sensitive to excess moisture[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2)[<sup>\[5\]</sup>](#fn5).
- Ensure the crop receives **6–8 hours of direct sunlight daily** for healthy growth and seed development.

**Fertilizers and Nutrients**

- Apply **5 tons FYM per hectare** before sowing to enhance soil organic matter[<sup>\[6\]</sup>](#fn6)[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2).
- Recommended fertilizer dose: **30:60:30 kg/ha of N:P2O5:K2O** for high yield[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2).
- Apply all phosphorus and potassium and half of nitrogen at sowing; remaining nitrogen at 30 days after sowing[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2).
- Supplement micronutrients like zinc or boron if soil tests indicate deficiencies.

**Weed Control**

- Maintain a weed-free field for the first **30 days** after sowing, as early weed competition reduces yields[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2).
- First weeding at **15–20 days** after sowing; second weeding at **30–35 days** if necessary[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2).
- Use hand hoes or pre-emergence herbicides such as **Pendimethalin (1 kg/ha)** when manual weeding is difficult[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2).
- Mulching with organic materials helps suppress weeds and conserve moisture.

**Pest and Disease Management**

- **Main pests:** Leaf roller, jassids, capsule borer, whitefly[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2)[<sup>\[5\]</sup>](#fn5).
- **Major diseases:** Phyllody, powdery mildew, stem rot[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2)[<sup>\[6\]</sup>](#fn6).
- Use resistant varieties and seed treatments as primary defense[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2).
- Spray neem oil or recommended pesticides when pest populations exceed economic thresholds[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2).
- Remove and burn infected plants to prevent disease spread.
- Practice crop rotation and field sanitation to reduce pest and disease buildup[<sup>\[6\]</sup>](#fn6)[<sup>\[3\]</sup>](#fn3).

**Monitoring Tips for Healthy Development**

- Thin extra seedlings **10–14 days after emergence** to maintain proper spacing[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2).
- Scout regularly for pests, diseases, and nutrient deficiencies.
- Maintain consistent soil moisture without waterlogging.

**3\. Harvesting**

**Best Time to Harvest**

- Harvest when **leaves, stems, and capsules turn yellow and start drying**, typically **80–100 days after sowing** depending on variety and season[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2)[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#fn1).
- Pods should be mature, turning brown or beige, and beginning to shatter naturally.
- Seed moisture content should be around **6–8%** for safe storage.

**Signs the Crop is Ready**

- Yellowing and drying of leaves and stems.
- Firm, hard seeds that resist crushing between fingers.
- Seed capsules start to open or shatter.

**Tools and Equipment Needed**

- Sickle or scythe for cutting plants at ground level.
- Bundling materials for stacking plants on the threshing floor.
- Sticks for beating bundles to release seeds.
- Winnowing tools for cleaning seeds.

**Post-Harvest Handling, Cleaning, and Storage**

- Stack cut plants in bundles with heads down on a threshing floor for **5–7 days** to dry[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2)[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#fn1).
- Beat bundles with sticks to release seeds from capsules.
- Clean seeds by winnowing to remove chaff and debris.
- Dry seeds in the sun for **2–3 days** to reduce moisture content further.
- Store seeds in clean, dry, airtight containers or bags in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated place.
- Use neem leaves in storage bags to deter pests.
- Regularly inspect stored seeds for insects or mold.

**Additional Details**

**Crop Rotation and Intercropping**

- Avoid growing sesame after sesame to reduce disease risk[<sup>\[6\]</sup>](#fn6)[<sup>\[3\]</sup>](#fn3).
- Rotate sesame with cereals like wheat, maize, rice or pulses like moong and urad to maintain soil health and break pest cycles[<sup>\[6\]</sup>](#fn6)[<sup>\[3\]</sup>](#fn3).
- Intercropping systems recommended by ICAR-IIOR include:
  - Sesame + Groundnut / Black gram (Gujarat, Tamil Nadu)
  - Sesame + Pearl millet / Cotton (Gujarat, Maharashtra)
  - Sesame + Green gram / Black gram (Madhya Pradesh, Odisha)
  - Sesame + Soybean (Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra)
  - Sesame + Pigeonpea (Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh)  
        (Ratios vary by region)[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#fn1).

**Yield**

- Good management practices yield **800–1200 kg/ha**; improved practices and varieties can exceed **1000 kg/ha**[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#fn2)[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#fn1).

**Tools Summary**

- Plough or tractor for land preparation.
- Harrow or hoe for tillage and weed control.
- Seed drill or hand tools for sowing.
- Sickle for harvesting.
- Basket or containers for seed handling.

**Tips for Success**

- Use certified seeds and treat before sowing.
- Maintain proper spacing for healthy growth.
- Keep the field weed-free during the critical first month.
- Monitor and control pests and diseases promptly.
- Dry seeds thoroughly before storage to prevent spoilage.
- Practice crop rotation and intercropping for sustainable production.
