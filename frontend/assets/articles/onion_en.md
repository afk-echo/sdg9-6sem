**Detailed Onion Farming Guide**

_Based on ICAR and Credible Indian Agricultural Institutions_

**About Onion**

Onion (Allium cepa) is a key vegetable and spice crop grown widely across India. It is consumed fresh, cooked, dried, and also has medicinal uses. Onion contributes to soil health and fits well in crop rotation systems. It grows in various soil types but prefers well-drained loamy soils rich in organic matter.

**1\. Planting**

**Types of Seeds and Varieties**

- Use **certified seeds** treated with fungicides to prevent seed-borne diseases.
- ICAR-DOGR has developed varieties suited for different seasons and regions, including high-yielding and disease-resistant lines.
- Seed rate for nursery beds: **2–4 kg per hectare**.

**Soil Preparation Methods**

- Plough the field 2–3 times to break clods and remove debris.
- Incorporate **15 tons of farmyard manure (FYM) or 7.5 tons of poultry manure per hectare** for organic matter enrichment.
- Prepare **raised beds or broad bed furrows (BBF)** about 15 cm high and 120 cm wide with 45 cm furrows (especially for Kharif) to improve drainage and prevent waterlogging.
- Level the field for uniform irrigation.

**Special Tools or Equipment Needed**

- Tractor or plough for land preparation.
- Nursery bed preparation tools.
- Hand tools for transplanting seedlings.
- Drip or sprinkler irrigation system.
- Hand hoes or mechanical weeders.
- Sickle for harvesting.

**Ideal Weather and Temperature Conditions for Planting**

- Onions grow best in mild temperatures between **13°C and 35°C**.
- Require **750–1000 mm rainfall**, but cannot tolerate waterlogging.
- Prefer well-drained, friable soils with pH between **6.0 and 7.0** (tolerate mild alkalinity up to 7.5).
- Avoid saline, acidic, or heavy waterlogged soils.

**Crop Seasons**

- **Kharif onion:** Sown May-June, harvested Sept-Oct. Requires raised beds to avoid anthracnose.
- **Rabi onion:** Major crop, sown Oct-Nov, harvested March-May.
- **Late Kharif:** Sown Sept, harvested Jan-Feb.

**2\. Growth**

**Seedling and Nursery Management**

- Sow seeds in well-prepared, weed-free nursery beds 6–7 weeks before transplanting.
- Maintain moisture and proper spacing for healthy seedlings.

**Transplantation**

- Transplant seedlings at **25–30 days old for Kharif**, and **45–60 days old for Rabi** crop.
- Space plants **15 cm apart** in rows **15–20 cm apart**.
- Transplant during cooler parts of the day (early morning or evening).
- Water gently after transplanting to reduce shock.

**Irrigation**

- Onions require **frequent, light irrigation** due to shallow roots.
- Irrigate at transplanting, 3 days after, then every 7–10 days depending on soil moisture.
- Use drip or sprinkler irrigation to save water and reduce disease incidence.
- Stop irrigation **10 days before harvest** to avoid bulb splitting and bolting.

**Fertilizer and Nutrient Management**

- Apply **75 kg nitrogen per hectare**, supplemented by balanced doses of phosphorus and potassium.
- Apply half nitrogen at transplanting and the rest after 30 days.
- Use micronutrients like zinc and boron if soil tests indicate deficiency.
- ICAR-DOGR recommends integrated nutrient management combining organic and inorganic sources for better yield.

**Weed Management**

- Maintain weed-free nursery and main field.
- First weeding at **15–20 days after transplanting**.
- Use hand weeding or mechanical weeders.
- Mulching reduces weed growth and conserves moisture.

**Pest and Disease Management**

- Major pests: Thrips, onion maggot, aphids.
- Major diseases: Purple blotch, downy mildew, anthracnose.
- Use resistant varieties and seed treatment.
- Spray neem oil or recommended pesticides when pest pressure is high.
- Practice crop rotation and field sanitation.
- Avoid waterlogging to reduce fungal diseases.

**Growth and Development**

- Bulb formation starts **40–50 days after transplanting**.
- Bulbs mature in **120–150 days** depending on season and variety.
- Stop watering **10–15 days before harvest** to harden bulbs.
- Monitor for uniform bulb size and maturity.

**3\. Harvesting**

**Best Time to Harvest**

- Harvest when **70–80% of tops fall and dry**.
- Pull bulbs carefully to avoid damage.
- Harvest in dry weather to prevent rotting.

**Signs the Crop is Ready**

- Tops dry and fall naturally.
- Bulbs firm and well-sized.

**Tools and Equipment Needed**

- Sickle or hand tools for harvesting.
- Drying mats or platforms for curing bulbs.

**Post-Harvest Handling, Cleaning, and Storage**

- Cure bulbs by drying in shade or sun for **3–5 days** to reduce moisture.
- Cut tops after curing.
- Store cured bulbs in ventilated, dry places using mesh bags or crates.
- Maintain storage temperature between **0–4°C** and humidity at **65–70%** for long storage.
- Regularly inspect stored bulbs for sprouting or rot.
- Use improved storage structures developed by ICAR-DOGR for enhanced shelf life.

**Additional Details**

**Crop Rotation**

- Rotate onion with cereals, legumes, or other vegetables to reduce pest buildup and maintain soil health.
- Avoid continuous onion cropping on the same land.

**Yield**

- Average yields range from **20 to 50 tonnes per hectare** depending on season, variety, and management.
- Proper irrigation, nutrient management, and pest control significantly increase yield.

**Tips for Success**

- Use certified, treated seeds and maintain proper nursery management.
- Maintain recommended spacing for good bulb size and air circulation.
- Avoid waterlogging and excess irrigation to prevent diseases and bolting.
- Use drip irrigation to conserve water.
- Practice integrated pest and disease management.
- Cure bulbs properly before storage.
- Rotate crops to maintain soil fertility and reduce disease incidence.
