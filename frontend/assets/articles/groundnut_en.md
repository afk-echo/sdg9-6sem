**Detailed Groundnut (Peanut) Farming Guide**

_Based on ICAR and Credible Indian Agricultural Institutions_

**About Groundnut**

Groundnut, also known as peanut, is an important oilseed crop grown in warm, sunny regions. It is used for oil extraction, food, and animal feed. Groundnut plays a vital role in crop rotation systems by improving soil health and breaking pest and disease cycles.

**1\. Planting**

**Types of Seeds Used**

- Use **bold, healthy, and well-matured seeds**.
- Shell seeds 1 week before sowing to improve germination.
- Treat seeds with recommended fungicides to prevent seed-borne diseases.

**Soil Preparation Methods**

- Deep ploughing (15–20 cm) to loosen soil and improve aeration.
- Harrow 3–4 times to break clods and prepare a fine seedbed.
- Remove weeds, stones, and old crop residues.
- Incorporate **5–10 tons of compost or farmyard manure per hectare** 2–3 weeks before sowing.
- Prepare broad or raised beds to improve drainage and prevent waterlogging.
- Level the field for uniform irrigation.

**Special Tools or Equipment Needed**

- Tractor or plough for land preparation.
- Harrow or hoe for tillage and weed control.
- Seed drill or hand tools for sowing.
- Sickle or knife for harvesting.
- Baskets or containers for harvesting and drying.

**Ideal Weather and Temperature Conditions for Planting**

- Groundnut grows best in **warm weather with temperatures between 25°C and 30°C**.
- Requires **600–1500 mm rainfall per year**, well-distributed during the growing season.
- Prefers **sandy loam or sandy clay loam soils** with good drainage.
- Soil pH should be between **6.5 and 7.0**.
- Avoid heavy clay or waterlogged soils.

**Crop Rotation**

- Rotate groundnut with wheat, maize, chickpea, or vegetables to reduce pest buildup and improve soil health.
- Avoid growing groundnut on the same land consecutively.

**Sowing Techniques and Spacing Tips**

- Seed rate:
  - **Bunch types:** 80–100 kg/ha
  - **Spreading types:** 60–80 kg/ha
- Sow seeds at a depth of **5–6 cm** in moist soil.
- Row spacing:
  - **Bunch types:** 30–40 cm apart
  - **Spreading types:** 45–60 cm apart
- Plant spacing:
  - **Bunch types:** 15 cm apart
  - **Spreading types:** 20 cm apart
- Sow seeds using a seed drill or by hand at the start of the rainy season (June–July) or after the first good rain.

**2\. Growth and Crop Care**

**Plant Growth Characteristics**

- Groundnut plants grow low and spread on the soil surface.
- Yellow flowers appear above ground; pegs develop from flowers and penetrate the soil where pods form underground.
- Keep soil loose to facilitate peg penetration.

**Fertilizer and Nutrient Management**

- Conduct soil testing before sowing to determine nutrient needs.
- Apply **10–12 tons of chicken manure or 20 tons of farmyard manure per hectare** about one month before sowing.
- Supplement with phosphorus, potassium, calcium, sulfur, and magnesium if soil is deficient.
- Avoid excessive nitrogen to prevent excessive vegetative growth at the expense of pods.

**Weed Management**

- Keep the field weed-free, especially during the first month.
- Perform weeding using hand hoes or mechanical weeders.
- Mulching helps suppress weeds and conserve soil moisture.

**Water Management**

- Groundnut requires adequate moisture during flowering, pegging, and pod-filling stages.
- Irrigate if rainfall is insufficient during these critical periods.
- Avoid flooding or waterlogging to prevent pod rot.
- Stop irrigation 10 days before harvest to allow pods to mature and dry.

**Pest and Disease Management**

- Common pests: aphids, leaf miners, thrips.
- Common diseases: leaf spots, rust, root rot.
- Use healthy seeds and practice crop rotation to reduce disease incidence.
- Remove and destroy infected plants promptly.
- Apply neem oil or recommended pesticides for pest control.
- Maintain field sanitation and weed control.

**3\. Harvesting**

**Best Time to Harvest**

- Harvest at **90–120 days** for bunch types and **120–150 days** for spreading types.
- Indicators: leaves turn yellow and start drying; pods are fully developed with dark inner shells.

**Harvesting Method**

- Uproot plants carefully to avoid pod damage.
- Shake off excess soil and dry plants in the field for 5–7 days.
- Remove pods by hand or with simple threshing tools.

**Post-Harvest Handling and Storage**

- Clean pods and dry in the sun for 2–3 days to reduce moisture.
- Store dry pods in clean, dry bags or bins in a cool, ventilated place.
- Use neem leaves in storage bags to deter pests.
- Regularly inspect stored pods for insect infestation or mold.

**Additional Details**

**Yield**

- With good management, yields range from **2 to 3 tonnes of pods per hectare**.
- Yield depends on soil quality, weather, seed quality, and crop care.

**Tools Summary**

- Plough or tractor for land preparation.
- Harrow or hoe for tillage and weed control.
- Seed drill or hand tools for sowing.
- Sickle or knife for harvesting.
- Baskets for harvesting and drying.

**Tips for Success**

- Use clean, healthy, and treated seeds every season.
- Maintain proper spacing and soil moisture.
- Keep the field weed-free during early growth stages.
- Monitor regularly for pests and diseases and take timely action.
- Practice crop rotation to maintain soil health and reduce pest pressure.
- Dry pods thoroughly before storage to prevent spoilage.
