**Detailed Tomato Farming Guide**

_Based on ICAR and Credible Indian Agricultural Institutions_

**About Tomato**

Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is one of the most widely grown vegetables in India, valued for its nutritional content rich in vitamins (especially vitamin C) and antioxidants like lycopene. It is used fresh, cooked, and processed into products like sauces and ketchup. Tomato adapts well to various climates and soils and fits well in crop rotations and kitchen gardens.

**1\. Planting**

**Types of Seeds Used**

- Use **certified seeds** of high-yielding varieties or hybrids such as:
  - **Arka Rakshak**, **Arka Alok**, **Pusa Ruby**, **Swarna Hybrid**.
- Treat seeds with fungicides or bioagents to prevent seed-borne diseases.
- Sow seeds in well-prepared nursery beds or trays 6–8 weeks before transplanting.

**Soil Preparation Methods**

- Plough the field 2–3 times to loosen soil and remove weeds, stones, and debris.
- Incorporate **20–25 tons of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost per hectare** to improve soil fertility and moisture retention.
- Level the field to ensure uniform irrigation.
- Prepare raised beds about 1 meter wide with furrows for drainage.

**Special Tools or Equipment Needed**

- Tractor or plough for land preparation.
- Nursery tools for seed sowing and seedling care.
- Hand trowels for transplanting.
- Stakes and twine for plant support.
- Irrigation systems (drip or sprinkler).
- Hand tools for weeding.
- Harvest baskets.

**Ideal Weather and Temperature Conditions for Planting**

- Tomato grows best in **warm, sunny weather** with temperatures between **20°C and 27°C**.
- Requires **600–800 mm rainfall annually**, preferably well-distributed.
- Avoid waterlogged or saline soils.
- Suitable for a wide range of agro-climatic zones.

**Sowing and Nursery Practices**

- Sow seeds in nursery beds or trays with proper spacing to avoid overcrowding.
- Maintain moisture and shade seedlings during hot midday hours.
- Harden seedlings by reducing watering 7 days before transplanting to improve survival.

**Transplantation**

- Transplant seedlings aged **25–30 days** when they have 4–6 true leaves.
- Space plants **45–60 cm apart** in rows **60–75 cm apart**.
- Transplant during cooler parts of the day (early morning or evening).
- Water seedlings immediately after transplanting to reduce transplant shock.

**2\. Growth**

**Fertilizer and Nutrient Management**

- Apply:
  - **Nitrogen (N): 75–100 kg/ha**
  - **Phosphorus (P2O5): 50–60 kg/ha**
  - **Potassium (K2O): 50–60 kg/ha**
- Apply half of nitrogen and full phosphorus and potassium at transplanting.
- Apply remaining nitrogen in two splits at **30 and 60 days after transplanting**.
- Use organic manures and biofertilizers (e.g., Azospirillum) to improve soil health.
- Supplement micronutrients such as calcium and magnesium if soil tests indicate deficiencies.

**Irrigation**

- Tomato requires **frequent irrigation**, especially during flowering and fruiting stages.
- Use **drip irrigation** for water efficiency and to reduce disease incidence.
- Avoid waterlogging to prevent root diseases like wilt and rot.
- Mulch to conserve soil moisture and suppress weeds.

**Weed Control**

- Keep the field weed-free for the first **40 days** after transplanting.
- Perform first weeding at **15–20 days** and subsequent weeding as needed.
- Use hand hoes or mechanical weeders.
- Mulching reduces weed growth and conserves moisture.

**Pest and Disease Management**

- **Common pests:** Fruit borer, aphids, whiteflies, thrips.
- **Common diseases:** Late blight, early blight, powdery mildew, bacterial wilt.
- Use resistant varieties and treat seeds before sowing.
- Spray neem oil or recommended pesticides when pest populations exceed thresholds.
- Practice crop rotation and maintain field sanitation.
- Remove and destroy infected plants promptly.

**Crop Care and Development**

- Plants flower **40–50 days after transplanting**.
- Fruits mature in **60–80 days** depending on variety.
- Support plants with stakes or trellises to prevent lodging and improve air circulation.
- Prune side shoots (suckers) regularly to improve fruit size and yield.

**3\. Harvesting**

**Best Time to Harvest**

- Harvest fruits when they are **fully colored, firm, and mature**.
- Pick fruits every **2–3 days** for continuous yield and to avoid over-ripening.
- Harvest during cooler parts of the day (morning or evening) to reduce heat damage.

**Signs the Crop is Ready**

- Fruits show uniform color (red, pink, or variety-specific).
- Firm texture with slight give on gentle pressure.

**Tools and Equipment Needed**

- Hand tools or simply hand-picking for harvesting.
- Harvest baskets or crates to avoid bruising.
- Drying mats or platforms if post-harvest drying is needed.

**Post-Harvest Handling, Cleaning, and Storage**

- Sort fruits by size and quality immediately after harvest.
- Store ripe tomatoes at **12–15°C** with **85–90% relative humidity** for shelf life extension.
- Green tomatoes can be stored at room temperature to ripen gradually.
- Use ventilated containers to avoid moisture accumulation and damage.
- Market produce quickly for best price and freshness.

**Additional Information**

**Crop Rotation and Intercropping**

- Rotate tomato with cereals (maize, wheat), legumes (chickpea), or other vegetables (onion, cabbage) to reduce pest and disease buildup.
- Avoid continuous tomato cultivation on the same land to prevent soil-borne diseases.

**Yield**

- Average yield ranges from **30 to 50 tonnes per hectare** with proper management.
- Improved varieties and good agronomic practices can increase yields further.

**Tips for Success**

- Use certified seeds and healthy seedlings.
- Maintain proper spacing for good air circulation and disease prevention.
- Employ drip irrigation to conserve water and reduce disease incidence.
- Mulch to reduce weeds and conserve soil moisture.
- Regularly monitor for pests and diseases and take timely action.
- Harvest fruits timely and handle gently to avoid bruising.
- Practice crop rotation to maintain soil health and reduce disease pressure.
