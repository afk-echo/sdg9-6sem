**Detailed Chickpea (Gram/Chana) Farming Guide**

_Based on ICAR, CRIDA, and Credible Indian Agricultural Institutions_

**About Chickpea**

- Chickpea (gram/chana) is a key pulse crop rich in protein and widely consumed in India.
- Two main types:
  - **Desi:** Small, dark seeds with rough coats, drought tolerant.
  - **Kabuli:** Large, light-colored seeds with smooth coats, preferred for taste.
- Fixes atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility and benefiting crop rotation.

**Climate and Soil Requirements**

- Thrives in **cool, dry climates** with temperatures between **15°C and 25°C**.
- Requires **60–90 cm annual rainfall**, well distributed; excess moisture harms yield.
- Prefers **deep, well-drained loamy or silty clay loam soils**.
- Soil pH ideal range: **6.0 to 8.0**.
- Avoid heavy clay or waterlogged soils.
- Remove old crop residues to reduce disease risk.
- Rough seedbed for heavy soils; fine and firm for light soils.

**Field Preparation**

- Plough 2–3 times to loosen soil up to 15–20 cm depth.
- Level field for uniform irrigation.
- Remove weeds, stones, and old roots.
- Use harrow or country plough for final tillage.
- Prepare raised beds or furrows if drainage is poor.
- Incorporate farmyard manure or compost to improve fertility.

**Seed Selection and Sowing**

- Use **75–100 kg certified, healthy seed per hectare**.
- Treat seeds with fungicide (Thiram or Carbendazim) at 2–3 g/kg.
- Inoculate seeds with Rhizobium 10–12 hours before sowing for nitrogen fixation.
- Sow in **second half of October** (early October in South India).
- Use seed drill or hand sowing.
- Sow seeds **5–8 cm deep**.
- Maintain row spacing of 30 cm and plant spacing of 10 cm (wider rows 45–60 cm for Kabuli).
- Light irrigation after sowing if soil is dry.

**Fertilizer and Nutrient Management**

- Apply **20 kg nitrogen and 40 kg phosphorus per hectare** before sowing.
- Add **20 kg potash and 20 kg sulfur** if soil deficient.
- Use farmyard manure or compost to improve soil health.
- In organic systems, use biofertilizers and compost.
- Treat seeds with ammonium molybdate (1 g/kg) in chickpea-soybean rotations.

**Water Management**

- Requires little water but critical during:
  - Branching stage (first irrigation).
  - Pod filling stage (second irrigation).
- Avoid flooding or waterlogging to prevent root rot.
- Bed planting improves water use in dry areas.

**Weed Control**

- Keep field weed-free for first 60 days.
- First weeding at 25–30 days after sowing.
- Second weeding at 60 days if necessary.
- Use hand hoe, khurpa, or power weeders in wider rows.
- Mulching helps suppress weeds and conserve moisture.

**Crop Care**

- Pinch growing tips (nipping) at 15–20 cm height to promote branching and pod set.
- Remove sick or weak plants to reduce disease spread.
- Install bird perches (50 per hectare) at flowering; remove before grain ripening.
- Thin extra plants to maintain proper spacing.

**Pest and Disease Management**

- Main pest: **Gram pod borer (Helicoverpa armigera)**; monitor with pheromone traps.
- Spray **5% neem seed kernel extract (NSKE)** at pre-flowering, repeat every 15 days.
- Use NPV or chemical pesticides (e.g., endosulfan) if infestation is high.
- Dust soil with chlorpyriphos before sowing for cutworm control.
- Control aphids with neem oil or yellow sticky traps.
- Use healthy seeds and seed treatment for wilt and root rot management.
- Remove and burn infected plants promptly.

**Growth and Development**

- Seeds germinate in 10–14 days.
- Optimal growth temperature: 15–25°C.
- Crop matures in 120–140 days.
- Soil moisture critical during pod filling.
- Excess rain during flowering/pod filling reduces yield.

**Harvesting**

- Harvest when 70–80% leaves turn yellow and dry.
- Cut or pull plants in dry weather.
- Stack plants for 5–7 days to dry.
- Thresh by beating with sticks or animals.
- Clean seeds by winnowing.
- Sun-dry seeds for 2–3 days before storage.

**Storage**

- Store dry seeds in clean, dry gunny or jute bags in cool, ventilated areas.
- Use neem leaves in bags to deter pests.
- Inspect regularly for insects or mold.

**Yield**

- Typical yield: 1.5–2 tonnes/ha.
- Improved management can raise yield to 2.5 tonnes/ha.

**Crop Rotation**

- Rotate with cereals like wheat, maize, sorghum.
- Avoid consecutive chickpea cropping to reduce diseases.
- Fits well after soybean or rice.

**Tools Needed**

- Tractor/plough for land prep.
- Harrow/hoe for tilling and weeding.
- Seed drill or hand tools for sowing.
- Sickle for harvesting.
- Sticks/threshers for threshing.

**Tips for Success**

- Use certified, treated seeds every year.
- Maintain weed-free fields for first 2 months.
- Monitor pests early; use neem-based sprays.
- Dry seeds well before storage.
- Practice crop rotation for soil health and pest control.
